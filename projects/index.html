      <a href="https://eberly.wvu.edu/"><h2>Eberly College of Art and Sciences</h2></a>
      <p class="lede">This site was my first foray into CleanSlate so I learned a lot about the CMS and WVU's brand.</p>
      <p>I focused a lot of creating something that would be user-friendly to both the audience and the editors who work on the content. I created a lot of custom patterns that can be interfaced right from the online cms, so editors can make very elaborate pages without a lot of custom code work. At the same time, I made sure its not overwhelming to editors who have little experience</p>
      <p>I used this site as the basis for the various department and program sites for Eberly. Finding a balance between consistencey and letting them have some uniqueness came from working directly with the editors of the departments to address their needs. The site is currently undergoing a redesign. I'll post some of that when its closer to launch.  </p>

        <h2>Eberly Magazine</h2></a>
      <p class="lede">The basic site design, a reskin of WVU Magazine, was already inplace. My touch has been in the updates and the articles.</p>
      <p>I really enjoy working on the stories within the magazine because its not often you get such great, flesh-out content to work with. I worked on creating articles that highlighted the imagery of the stories told and the people telling them. This is another that I'm redesigning at the moment. The challenge here will be working on a better way to structure the site that doesn't neccessitate migrating all the content (but it might).</p>

        <h2>West Virginia United Health Systems</h2>
      <p class="lede">Update: The site was recently rebranded under WVU Medicine</p>
      <p>Though its gone now, it was a great learning experience. It was one of the most visible sites I worked on at HSC and had a lot of work put into its creation. The WVUHS site was created from the ground up in the Umbraco CMS that was customized by the HSC team. We put a lot of thought into designing a system that worked from the ground up and worked very closely with our programming team.</p>

      <p class="lede">A prototype website I built for the research division of HSC.</p>
      <p>Though this site design was live for only a short time, I preserved the first draft on my site. It was a fun little project that I learned a lot from.</p>
